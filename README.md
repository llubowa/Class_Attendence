# Class_Attendence
The project aims at predicting if the enrolled student will attend the fittness classes or not.
A body fitness institution wants to raise on the enrollment count after noticing that a good number of enrolled students do not attend the classes.
A model is to predict the count of enrolled students who will not attend classes and this gives the additional number to be enrolled.
This project also compares the performance of two predictors chosen for this project.
