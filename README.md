# Class_Attendence
This predictive model determines whether enrolled students will attend fitness classes at a body fitness institution. The project addresses the institution's goal of increasing attendance by identifying students likely to skip classes. The model predicts the count of enrolled students who may not attend, aiding in calculating the additional enrollment needed to meet attendance targets. Additionally, the project involves comparing the performance of two selected predictors, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance class participation and optimize enrollment strategies.
